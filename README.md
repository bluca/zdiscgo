# zdiscgo
CZMQ service discovery zactor with support for Go plugins.

## Problem Statement
Problem: I want to use various service discovery mechanisms with CZMQ, such as consul and marathon.
I am lazy, and these service discovery APIs have nice Go clients.

## Status
Work in Progress. Not usable yet.
